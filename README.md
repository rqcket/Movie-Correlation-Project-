# Basic Movie Correlation Project

This basic Movie Correlation Analysis project is a data analysis project that explores the relationship between a movie's gross earnings and various other parameters. This project aims to provide insights into the factors that may influence a movie's financial success. The analysis is visualized using basic **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** graphs.

## Project Phases:

### Data Cleaning:

Raw data from various sources often requires extensive cleaning to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Data cleaning involves handling missing values, correcting data types, and addressing inconsistencies.
Duplicates and outliers may be removed to maintain data integrity.

### Data Exploration:

Basic statistics and visualizations are generated to gain an initial understanding of the dataset.
Descriptive statistics, histograms, and box plots can be used to summarize the data.

### Correlation Analysis:

The primary focus of the project is to explore the correlation between gross earnings and other parameters.
Parameters such as production budget, movie ratings are chosen to assess their influence on earnings.

### Visualization:

Matplotlib and Seaborn, Python libraries for data visualization, are used to create various graphs that illustrate correlations.
Scatter plots, line plots are created to visually represent the relationships between gross earnings and other variables.
Color-coding and labels make the graphs more informative.

### Insights:

The project concludes by providing insights into the relationships observed in the visualizations.
